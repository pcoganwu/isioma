		  <p class="tahiti">Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, 
		  the South Pacific archipelago. Shaped like a figure-8, 
		  it's divided into Tahiti Nui (the larger, western section) and Tahiti Iti 
		  (the eastern peninsula). With black-sand beaches, lagoons, waterfalls and 2 extinct volcanoes, 
		  it's a popular vacation destination. Explored by Captain James Cook in the 18th century, 
		  it was also often painted by French artist Paul Gauguin.</p>

			 <p class="boracay">Boracay is a small island in the Philippines located approximately 315 kilometres (196 mi)
             south of Manila and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) off the northwest tip of Panay Island in Western Visayas region 
			 of the Philippines. Boracay Island and its beaches have received awards from numerous travel publications and 
			 agencies.[Note 1] The island comprises the barangays of Manoc-Manoc, Balabag, and Yapak in the municipality of Malay, 
			 in Aklan Province. The island is administered by the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority and 
			 the provincial government of Aklan. Apart from its white sand beaches, Boracay is also famous for being one of the 
			 world's top destinations for relaxation.[11][12] As of 2013 it was emerging among the top destinations for tranquility 
			 and nightlife.[13] Boracay was awarded as the 2012 best island in the world from the international travel magazine 
			 Travel + Leisure.[14][15] In 2014, the resort island was at the top of the Best Islands in the World list 
			 published by the international magazine Condé Nast Traveler.[16] In 2016, Boracay headed the magazine's list 
			 of Top 10 destinations to watch.[17] In April 2018 the Philippine Government decreed a 6-month closure 
			 of the island for tourists to undertake major renovation works, especially of the sewerage system,
             which had become obsolete and insufficient.[18]. It re-opened in October 2018 with a set of new rules
             meant to address a variety of issues [19]. </p>
